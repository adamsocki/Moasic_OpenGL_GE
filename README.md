# How to create a fresh .sln project file in Visual Studio

To run your game thru Visual Studio do these steps:
1. click "Open a Project or Solution"
2. Navigate to the build/game.exe directory that's created when you compile your code.
3. select game.exe
4. Go to file->save all and save a "game.sln" file in the directory of the project (not in the build directory!)
5. Close visual studio.
6. goto "open a project or solution" and open game.sln
You must do these steps to use visual studio debugger. Once you open the solution on step 6 you should see a green "Run" button at the top of visual studio. You can run your game using that, and set breakpoints as we discussed in class.
